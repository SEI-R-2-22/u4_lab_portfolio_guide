# Portfolio Guide

Your portfolio is an opportunity to show potential employers who you are and what you can do - a chance for you to articulate your personal brand.  It is an evolving project that will grow with you over time.  Put in the effort to ensure you create something that is an accurate reflection of your professional and creative accomplishments.

## Design considerations

- This is not the time for heavy-hitting frameworks like React or Vue.  It is recommended that you stick with basic html & css.
- Keep your portfolio simple and welcoming


## Required Sectionsa

- __Headline/introduction:__ Include name, professional title, and what you do.
- __About Me:__ Share your professional story in a way that shows your personality and helps potential employers connect with you.  Be sure to share what you do, why you do it, and how you do it.  Keep it brief.
- __Resume:__  Users should be able to both view and download a pdf version.
- __Contact info:__  Include links to all relevant social accounts, including Github and LinkedIn, along with a professional email address. (Other _professional_ profiles might include Medium, Instagram or Twitter)
- __Project Showcase:__ _See below_

## Project Showcase

__Include:__

- App/project name
- A short description along with the tech stack used to create it
- A link to the deployed project
- A link to the github repo
- A screenshot of the landing page
- Showcase a minimum of 3 projects.  
- Remember that we've made some pretty impressive apps that weren't necessarily "projects" - consider putting some TLC into homework or labs like tic-tac-toe or RAWG Router to make them worthy of display in your portfolio

## Further Considerations

Do each of my github repos include professional readmes?

Is my portfolio mobile responsive?

Is my font choice clear and easy to read?

Do I have a clear call to action (i.e. does my portfolio encourage users to get in contact with me?)

Remember this guide is only a minimum - think of it as a list of MVP requirements!  If you have more to offer (like a video introduction, or gifs of your or app in action) feel free to add those things as well!  Just keep it personal, professional, and simple.
